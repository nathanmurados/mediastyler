If you're after more detail though you basically want to do the following:

1) Make sure you have referenced JQuery. Generally that means putting the following in your HTML 

&lt;script
  src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"
  integrity="sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo="
  crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

2) Select the elements you want to stylise
